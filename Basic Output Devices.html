			<h4 class="par">Digital I/O</h4>
			<p class="par">The Uno uses the ATMega328 processor, which has 14 digital I/O pins (Some of these pins are multifunctional) </p>
			<p class="par">A digital I/O pin can input or output digital (0, 5V) signals</p>
			
			<h4 class="par">Digital I/O Functions</h4>
			<p class="par">The Arduino system provides 3 functions for the manipulation of digital I/O.</p>
			<p class="par">Need to:</p>
			<p class="par">- Configure the pin (pinMode()), before</p>
			<p class="par">- Using the pin</p>
			
			<h4 class="par">digitalWrite (pin, {LOW|HIGH})</h4>
			<p class="par">Outputs a LOW (0V) or HIGH (5V) to a digital pin</p>
			<p class="par">The digital pin must be configured as OUTPUT</p>
			
			<h4 class="par">Driving an LED</h4>
			<p class="par">An LED lights up (conducts) if a correct voltage is applied to the pins</p>
			<p class="par">When the LED conducts, current is allowed to pass through. The LED drops about 2V</p>
			<p class="par">We need to limit this current (10~20mA) otherwise, we will get a short-circuit</p>
			<p class="par">Current limiting resistor value: R = V/I</p>

The orientation of the molecules in the liquid crystal changes when an electric current is applied, allowing or preventing light from passing through the display. The images seen on the screen are the result of this. Due to their low power consumption, high resolution, and compact size, LCD displays are popular in electronics. Televisions, computer monitors, smartphones, and calculators all make use of them.</p>
			
			<h4>I2C Interface</h4>
			<p class="par">The I2C protocol is widely used for serial communication between integrated circuits.

			<h4>Oled Displays SSD1306</h4>
			<p class="par">The SSD1306 is a well-known OLED display controller chip that uses a serial interface to communicate with displays. OLED displays are good for portable devices and small electronics projects because they are thin, light, and don't need backlighting. The SSD1306 is simple to integrate with microcontrollers and offers features like contrast control and scrolling. It is a convenient and adaptable option for controlling OLED displays due to its low power consumption and high contrast ratio.</p>
			
			<h4>NeoPixels</h4>
			<p class="par">Neopixels, which are also referred to as WS2812 or WS2812B, are programmable RGB LEDs that each have their own microcontroller that can use to control them. They are frequently utilized in interactive installations, stage lighting, and decorative lighting due to their adaptability and vibrant colors. Neopixels are user-friendly because they can be controlled with a variety of programming languages and platforms. They are compatible with a wide range of development boards and microcontrollers, including the Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
			
			<h4>Motors</h4>
			<p class="par">Arduino is capable of driving and controlling DC, stepper, and servo motors among other types of motors. In order to produce motion, motors transform electrical energy into mechanical energy. In order to connect the digital or analog output pins of an Arduino to motor drivers or motor shields, power and control signals are sent to the motor. Code that is uploaded to the Arduino controls the speed and direction of the motor. In robotics, automation, and other electronic projects, they are frequently used.</p>
			
			<h4>DC Motor Control</h4>
			<p class="par">Using the Arduino microcontroller, DC motor control is regulating the speed and direction of a DC motor. By connecting the DC motor to a motor driver or shield that is connected to the Arduino's digital output pins, this can be accomplished. The motor driver adjusts the voltage and current supplied to the motor in response to signals from the Arduino and regulates the motor's speed and direction. PWM or direct digital control of the motor can be programmed into the Arduino. Electric vehicles, robotics, and automation all rely heavily on DC motor control.</p>
			
			<h4>Motor Control with PWM</h4>
			<p class="par">Motor control with PWM is the process of adjusting the duty cycle of a square wave signal sent by the microcontroller to control a motor's speed. An Arduino digital output pin is used to generate the square wave, which is then fed into a motor driver. Using code uploaded to the Arduino, the duty cycle can be varied, allowing for precise motor speed control. PWM motor control is frequently utilized in robotics and automation applications.</p>
			
			<h4>H-Bridge</h4>
			<p class="par">An electronic circuit called an H-bridge is used to direct DC motors in the right direction. To control the motor's current flow and direction, it has four switches arranged in an "H" pattern that can be turned on and off in various combinations. It is common to use this with microcontrollers like the Arduino because it gives the motor the ability to spin forward or backward. In robotics and automation projects, H-bridges are frequently utilized.</p>
			
			<h4>H-Bridge Connections</h4>
			<p class="par">There are four input/output connections in H-bridges: Inches 1, 2, 3, and 4. The motor's direction is controlled by IN1 and IN2, while its speed is controlled by IN3 and IN4. The motor is connected to OUT1 and OUT2, the H-bridge is connected to the Arduino's digital output pins IN1 and IN2, and the PWM analog output pins IN3 and IN4 are connected to the motor. Consult the H-bridge's datasheet for specific pin connections as they may vary.</p>
			
			<h4>Stepper Motors</h4>
			<p class="par">Stepper motors move in precise steps, with each step representing a particular rotational angle. In order to rotate the motor shaft, they have multiple coils that are energized in a predetermined order. By sending signals to the motor's coils in the correct order, Arduino microcontrollers can control the stepper motor's direction and speed. Applications like 3D printers and CNC machines that require precise positioning use stepper motors. Typically, a stepper motor driver is used to connect the microcontroller to the motor's coils and supply the necessary power and control signals.</p>
			
			<h4>Servo Motors</h4>
			<p class="par">A motor designed for precise angle rotation and position holding is a servo motor. It is frequently utilized in automation and robotics. A motor, a control circuit, and a feedback mechanism are typically its components. The servo is connected to a digital output pin on the Arduino, where it receives a PWM signal from the microcontroller to determine the desired position. The servo motor control library included in Arduino makes programming easier.</p>
			
			<h4>Typically Relay Module</h4>
			<p class="par">An electronic component called a relay module enables high-power devices to be controlled by low-power signals from a microcontroller like an Arduino. It has a driver circuit, an electromagnetic switch, and a relay that can be turned on by a low-voltage signal. In automation and control systems, relay modules are used to turn on and off high-power devices like lights and motors.</p>
			
			<h4>Relay Connections</h4>
			<p class="par">To connect a relay module to an Arduino, connect one of the Arduino's digital output pins to the relay module's input pin, and then connect the relay module's output pin to the device being controlled. Check that the relay module can handle the voltage and current of the controlled device. It is essential to refer to the datasheet and adhere to the suggested wiring diagram because the pin connections may differ depending on the particular relay module being utilized.</p>
